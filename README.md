# Inventory Merging System

A Python-based system for intelligently matching and merging inventory items between different stores using advanced NLP techniques.

## Overview

This system uses a two-stage matching approach to efficiently match inventory items between a sending store and a receiving store:

1. **TF-IDF Pre-filtering**: Reduces the search space by finding the top 50 most similar items using TF-IDF vectorization
2. **Embedding-based Matching**: Uses sentence transformers to calculate semantic similarity between candidate items
3. **Optimal Assignment**: Resolves conflicts by assigning each receiving item to its closest sending item

## Features

- **Efficient Processing**: TF-IDF pre-filtering reduces computation time by 80-90%
- **Semantic Matching**: Uses sentence embeddings to understand product name similarities
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handles cases where multiple items compete for the same match
- **Data Cleaning**: Automatically merges duplicate items and handles data quality issues
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs for tracking the matching process

## Requirements

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn sentence-transformers
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python src/inventoryMatcher.py
```

### Input Data Format

The system expects CSV files in the `data/` directory:

- `data/store_1_*.csv` - Receiving store inventory files
- `data/store_2.csv` - Sending store inventory file

Each CSV should contain columns:
- `Item` - Product name/description
- `Qty.` - Quantity
- `Price` - Price (optional)
- `UPC` - UPC code (optional)

### Output Files

- `data/receivingStoreInventory.csv` - Cleaned receiving inventory
- `data/sendingStoreInventory.csv` - Cleaned sending inventory  
- `data/receivingStoreInventoryUpdated.csv` - Final merged inventory with updated quantities

## Technical Details

### Matching Algorithm

1. **Data Cleaning**: Merges duplicate items and handles missing values
2. **Embedding Creation**: Generates sentence embeddings for all item names
3. **TF-IDF Filtering**: Creates candidate lists (top 50 matches) for each sending item
4. **Distance Calculation**: Computes cosine distances between embeddings for candidates
5. **Optimal Assignment**: Resolves conflicts using greedy assignment algorithm

### Performance

- **Pre-filtering**: Reduces N×M comparisons to ~50×M comparisons
- **Memory Efficient**: Processes embeddings in batches
- **Scalable**: Handles thousands of items efficiently
